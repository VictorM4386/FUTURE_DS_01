##INTRODUCTION
This project explores the titanic dataset to uncover insights about the passengers, survival rates, and other interesting patterns using an excel dashboard.

##PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project involves cleaning and analyzing the titanic dataset using microsoft excel to create a comprehensive dashboard . The dashboard provides visual insights into the data,such as the descriptive analysis, correlation matrix,age distribution and survival rates by differnet categories. The goal is to provide a clear and interactive way to explore the data and derive meaningful conclusions.

##DATA MODELS
The dataset used includes the following Key variables:
PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger. 
Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes). 
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd). 
Name: Name of the passenger. 
Sex: Gender of the passenger.  
Age: Age of the passenger. 
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard. 
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard. 
Ticket: Ticket number. 
Fare: Fare paid for the ticket.  
Cabin: Cabin number. 
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

##TOOLS USED
1.Microsoft Excel: For data cleaning, analysis and visualization.
2.Pivot Tables: For analyzing data and creating slicers.
3.Excel formulas and functions: To perform descriptive statistics and data manipulation
4.Excel Charts: To create visualizations such as barcharts, Histogram, LineCharts.

##DASHBOARD FEATURES
The Excel dashboard includes the following features:
1. Interactive Filters: Filters to select specific categories like passenger class, gender, and survival status.
2.  Visualizations: A descriptive analysis table, correlation matrix, age distribution histogram and line and barcharts for survival rates by different categories.
3. Key Insights: Survival Rates by Gender: Analysis showing higher survival rates for female passengers.
   Class and Survival Rates: Visualization depicting better survival rates for first-class passengers.
   Age and Survival Rates: Insights on how age impacts survival rates.
 4. Additional Analysis: Correlation matrix to understand relationships between different variables.
     - Summary statistics to provide an overview of the data distribution.
